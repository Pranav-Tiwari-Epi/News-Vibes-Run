== Technologies Used

- **Flask Framework**: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs using Flask.
- **Python**: The programming language used for the backend development.
- **MySQL**: A robust and scalable relational database for storing blog posts, user information, and related data. 
- **Docker**: Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. 
- **VADER sentiment**: *Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning* (VADER) is a popular rule-based sentiment analyzer. It uses a list of lexical features (e.g. word) which are labeled as positive or negative according to their semantic orientation to calculate the text sentiment.

Vader is optimized for social media data and can yield good results when used with data from twitter, facebook, etc.

The main drawback with the rule-based approach for sentiment analysis is that the method only cares about individual words and completely ignores the context in which it is used.
